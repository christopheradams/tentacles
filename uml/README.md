=====

These diagrams were created using [UMLGraph](http://www.umlgraph.org/doc.html). See the [installation instructions](http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/install.html) and [usage options](http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/cd-oper.html) for more information.

If you've installed the `umlgraph` script, you can recreate a diagram by running the script in this directory. Using `TypeHierarchy.java` for input and PNG for output, the command is:

    umlgraph TypeHierarchy png
